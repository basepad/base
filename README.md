# Base

Base is a monorepo for all of Basepad's libraries and applications.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

#### Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `version 16.16.0`

Highly recommend using `n` to manage node versions and quickly switch

```bash
brew install n # install n using brew
n --version # check if installed
n 16.16.0 # install node version
```

#### Pnpm

[Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) `version 7.26.0 or above`

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:basepad/base.git # clone the repo
cd base # cd into the repo
pnpm i # install dependencies
code . # open the repo in VSCode
```

Install the recommended VSCode extensions.

### Running the app

```bash
pnpx nx serve apps-basepad-website # serve the basepad website app
```

However its best to run the app using Nx Console within VSCode.

1. `cmd+shift+p`
2. `>Nx: serve` or `>Nx: run-many` to serve multiple apps
